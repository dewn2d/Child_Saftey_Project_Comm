1) install software
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install ppp screen elinks

2) In order to enable it GPIO serial port, edit config.txt:

	$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt

   add the line (at the bottom):

	enable_uart=1

   As of May 2016 this will also lock the cpu core frequency for you 
   so there’s nothing else you need to do (If you aren’t convinced 
   and you really like to belt and braces it the command is:  
   core_freq=250 which you add to the same file aswell).

   Reboot for the changes to take effect.

   This should get you good serial communications for most uses.

--------------------- 3 may not be needed --------------------
3 ) If you are using the serial port for anything other than the 
   console you need to disable it. 
   The “disable” will stop it loading in the future.

   For Raspberry Pi 3’s the command is similar but referencing /dev/
   ttyS0:

	$ sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
	$ sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
   You also need to remove the console from the cmdline.txt. If you 
   edit this with:

	$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

   you will see something like:

   dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/
   dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes 
   root wait
   
   remove the line: 

	console=serial0,115200
 
   and save and reboot for changes to take effect.
